        <h2 id="Evolution">WHAT IS</h2>
        <p ><H3>HTML is the language with which the content of web pages is defined. Basically it is a set of tags used to define the text and other elements that make up a web page, such as images, lists, videos, etc.</H3></p>
        <h3><p style="text-align: justify;">HTML is an element markup language for creating hypertext documents, very easy to learn, which allows anyone, even if they have not programmed in life, to face the task of creating a website. HTML is easy and soon we will be able to master t
			he language. Later, professional results will be achieved thanks to our design skills and our artistic vein, as well as the incorporation of other languages to define the format with which the websites must be presented, such as CSS.</p></h3>

        <h2 id="1.0">HTML 1.0</h2>
		<h3><p style="text-align: justify;">HTML 1.0 was the first release of HTML to the world. Not many people were involved in website creation at the time, and the language was very limiting. There really wasn’t much you could do with it bar getting some simple text onto the web. But then, just that got the beardos a-foamin’ back in the day.</p></h3>

		<br>
		<br>
        <h2 id="2.0">HTML 2.0</h2>
		<p><h3>The structure of the document is simplified to the maximum to speed up its edition, 
			where the clean declaration of the body, html and head elements is optional. This did not support tables</h3></p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h2 id="3.2">HTML 3.2</h2>
		<p><h3>This revision incorporated the latest advances in web pages developed
			up to 1996, such as Java applets and text flowing around images.</h3></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h2 id="4.01">HTML 4.01</h2>
		<p><h3>He focused on the development of the XHTML standard. For this
			reason, in 2004, the companies Apple, Mozilla and Opera expressed their concern
			about the lack of interest of the W3C in HTML and decided to organize themselves
			into a new association called WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology
			Working Group) that began the development of the HTML5.</h3></p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		<h2 id="5.0">HTML 5.0</h2>
		<h3><p style="text-align: justify;">The international consortium W3C, after an evolution of several years, released HTML 5 as an official standard 
			at the end of October 2014. HTML 5 incorporates new elements not contemplated in HTML 4.01. There are several changes from HTML 4.01. There are 
			new labels, the possibility of inserting audio and video directly on the web without the need for plugins or add-ons in browsers, and other new features. 
			The W3C will progressively release new evolutions of HTML 5.</p></h3>
